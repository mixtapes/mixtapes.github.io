# Mixtapes

Please read first what this project is about [here](README.md).

## Motivation

I've started this project a long time ago, when I was working at [Last.fm](http://last.fm), that's been years ago now. Unfortunately I tend to get quite busy with loads of different stuff, having a full time development position that takes quite a bit of my focus, having a girlfriend, running a radio show, etc.

After a few years I've come to realise that in case I want this project to be built then I'll need help of others. Others who care about DJ mixes as much as I do. Others who are always looking for that ID of a track. Others who want to read about the producers who write the tracks we all fall in love with.

## How to get in touch

I'm looking for people with different skills to build the whole thing. You can read about the [architecture](README.md) of the project to get to know what we are building. Essentially I'm looking for coders, UX and graphical designers also.

If you are interested in joining me, please hit me up on [twitter - @mixtapescc](twitter.com/mixtapescc).

## Who can help

##### Developers

The service is built using multiple different components, such as the desktop client, the web interface and the REST API. (See the [artchitecture](README.md#architecture) docs for more info)

If any of the folowing means anything to you, you could help us building the service:

* Ruby On Rails
* Ember.js
* MongoDB
* JSON APIs
* Objective-C or Apple Switft (to port the OS X client)

You could also head over to the main Github organisation and see the code, have a look at issues, etc. Fork and create a pull request. All code is open source.

##### Graphics/UX Designers

I'm looking for people who can help designing the visual look and feel of the Mixtapes website.

I used to design sites, graphics, etc but that was a long time ago. My sense of graphics is not so great anymore. I can tell if something looks nice, if something is built around well thought out functionality. But I can't make pixels look so nice like others. I've been collecting some nice and [inspirational images](https://dribbble.com/attilagyorffy/buckets/218757-Tracklist-inspiration) from Dribbble if you want to have a look at them.

##### Broadcasters (DJs)

An important part of the development process involves people who would be willing to use Mixtapes, try it out and send us valuable feedback. If you have an idea, please hit us up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/mixtapescc) and we could discuss.
